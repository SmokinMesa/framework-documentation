# Changes from v1

- changed imports.scss and app.css to be more semantic
- restructued layout
	- "core" are functional scaffold components
	- "saas" are components for SaaS template sites (as Stefans designs)
	- "apex" sit within the apex suite
- simplified UI Kit / imports
	- uikit folder now has its own imports for core styles, these are those that require no mixin/include
	- customisable componets now don't self instantiate in the component, now done in _theme.scss for simplified theming (and less duplication of code)
- added site-width variables for more customisation for layouts
- flex-maker renamed to flex
- layout generator can take custom col-margin
- enhanced col layout engine, can now append class so col stays a col-6 on "tablet" (-s) and "mobile (-m)"
- typography
	- no longer appling colour to paragraphy elements
	- padding-bottom added to headings
- forms
	- form styles not kept local to client (will add a basic "reset" sheet if needed in future)
- NEW COMPONENTS:
	- toast, alert system (WIP)
